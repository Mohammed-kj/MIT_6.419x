## Objectives

In this lecture, we will:
- Learn the definition of a graph and different types of graphs we will use.
- Learn what is an adjacency matrix and use it.
- Learn the following graph metrics: connected components, degree distribution, path lengths, shortest paths, diameter, average distance, clustering coefficient, and modularity.
- Learn how these graph metrics capture real-world notions about networks.

## Introduction to Networks

**Graphical Models versus Network Models**
- Graphical models: Data on the nodes, infer network (randomness on the nodes)
- Network modedels (random graph models): data on the edge (randomness on the edges)
